A wish list of things that I should experiment with.

* TODO Replace constants with iota and stringer see `go doc stringer`.
* TODO What is the value of TokenLiteral every where? should it be removed?
* TODO Implement Unicode Lexer so Monkey can be UTF8 compatible.
* TODO Parser tests are repetitive they require re-thinking and re-writing also the use of sub tests
* TODO String Literal tokenising should support escape characters.
* TODO Fix/Remove all the error types in the evaluator
* TODO Evaluate ast implementation it could be improved
* TODO The object system is weird can we simplify?
* TODO The repl needs enhancements with up/down keys
* TODO The repl should take in source code.
* TODO Source code organization? packages?
* TODO Add Line/Column numbers to Lexer/Parser errors
